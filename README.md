# Arduino-RFID-Attendance

## INTRODUCTION

* This project aims to provide an efficient and secure way to record attendance in organizations, colleges, and schools using RFID technology. The traditional paper-based attendance system can be prone to errors and proxy attendance, but an RFID-based system can help eliminate these issues.

* This system is designed to be used at different educational institutions, corporate offices, government offices, and other organizations. It uses RFID tags attached to ID cards to uniquely identify each employee or student and record their attendance. The communication is wireless using electromagnetic and electrostatic coupling.

* The system is deployed using an Arduino Uno and other microcontrollers. It provides an effortless, quicker, and secure way to record attendance compared to the conventional method of signing on a paper. With this system, institutional authorities can easily monitor attendance and reduce the risk of errors and fraudulent activities.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the RFID attendance system. 

## ABSTRACT

This project proposes an RFID-based attendance system as an efficient and secure alternative to traditional paper-based attendance systems. The system is designed to be used in various educational institutions, corporate offices, and government offices. It uses RFID tags attached to ID cards to uniquely identify each employee or student and record their attendance. The system is deployed using an Arduino Uno and other microcontrollers, and it communicates wirelessly using electromagnetic and electrostatic coupling. The system provides an effortless, quicker, and secure way to record attendance, reducing the risk of errors and fraudulent activities such as proxy attendance.

## COMPONENTS REQUIRED

## COMPONENTS DESCRIPTION

 -**ARDUINO UNO**
 
This is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328p microcontroller. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, and supports serial communication via USB. The CH340G chip is used to convert USB signals to serial signals, allowing it to communicate with the computer.

 -**Mini Micro SD Card Reader Module**
 
 This is a small module that allows you to read and write data to microSD cards. It has a built-in level shifter, so it can be used with both 3.3V and 5V systems.

 -**Tiny RTC Real Time Clock DS1307 I2C IIC**
 
This is a real-time clock (RTC) module that uses the DS1307 chip. It communicates via I2C and provides accurate timekeeping even when the power is off.


 -**Transparent 400 Points Solderless Breadboard** 

This is a breadboard that allows you to prototype electronic circuits without soldering. It has 400 points and a transparent design that makes it easy to see the connections.

 -**Ai Thinker ESP01S ESP8266 WiFi Module** 

This is a small WiFi module based on the ESP8266 chip. It can be used to connect the system to the internet and enable remote monitoring and control.

 -**Jumper cables** 

These are cables with male-to-male, male-to-female, and female-to-female connectors that are used to connect the components together. They come in various lengths and colors to help keep the connections organize
